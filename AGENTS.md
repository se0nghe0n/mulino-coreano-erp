# AGENTS.md

This file is the operating guide for agent sessions working in this repository, and the only place this guidance is written. Codex reads it natively; Claude Code does not, so root `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to it rather than a second copy. Directory-scoped guidance lives in a nested `AGENTS.md`.

## Project Overview

A hypothetical ERP + AI agent governance system assuming Mulino Bianco (an Italian food brand) enters the Korean market. A SAP consulting portfolio project that localizes a EU-standard ERP to Korean food regulations (Food Traceability Act, 22 allergens, electronic tax invoices, etc.).

**Current status**: Phase 4 is in progress. The Spring Boot backend implements Case intake, inventory lookup, event dispatch and Run scheduling; `mcp-server/` provides a local stdio connector. PostgreSQL has 30 ERP tables plus 13 interface tables and one request receipt table. On top of that, `main` already has the common response/exception layer and Swagger (#16). `governance/`, `dashboard/` and the Zig CLI remain scaffolds. Actual LLM execution, other ERP approval/write adapters and channel authentication remain future work. The local human-answer and purchasing decision contract is in `docs/14_human_purchase_api.md`; see `docs/08_interface_overview.md` §13 for the wider boundary. What remains in Phase 4, and every Phase after it, lives on the project board rather than only in this file. All business documentation is written in Korean.

## Commands

Use Java 21 and PostgreSQL 18. For the backend, create an empty DB and configure `DB_URL`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD` locally; Flyway applies V1–V29, including the required Orchestrator/channel bootstrap. Use a separate disposable DB for integration tests.

```bash
cd backend
./gradlew clean test bootJar --no-daemon
./gradlew bootRun
# From the repository root in a separate terminal:
cd mcp-server
npm ci
npm test
npm start
```

The standalone DDL in `database/ddl/` is the schema's readable SSOT and must stay in sync with Flyway. To build a database from the DDL directly:

```bash
# After creating the DB, run in FK-dependency order (file number order is mandatory)
createdb mulino_coreano
psql -d mulino_coreano -f database/ddl/00_types.sql
psql -d mulino_coreano -f database/ddl/01_master_tables.sql

```

**Planned stack** (new code follows this baseline): Backend is Spring Boot 4.1.x + Java 21 + Gradle exposing a REST API. Agents are Claude Code or Codex sessions (Cowork) driven by per-role skills; the planned agent tool surface is a single Zig CLI (`mulino`) calling the REST API. Dashboard is React 19 + Vite. There is no A2A protocol — the runtime's native subagent dispatch (Claude Code or Codex) replaces it. The implemented `mcp-server/` is a local stdio interface connector using the same REST API; remote HTTP transport and the Zig CLI remain future work.

## Architecture (4 layers = directory mapping)

| Layer | Directory | Role |
|---|---|---|
| L0 | `database/`, `backend/` | PostgreSQL 18 (30 ERP + 13 interface + 1 request receipt tables) + Spring Boot REST API (single entry point for CLI and dashboard) |
| L1 | `governance/` | Intercept action-bearing API calls → approve / block / hold + audit log. **Reads pass through; only writes are gated** |
| L2 | `agents/` | `cli/` (Zig `mulino` binary) + `skills/` (orchestrator / supply-chain / procurement / qc). Claude Code and Codex are both supported agent runtimes; the orchestrator dispatches role subagents. See `agents/AGENTS.md` |
| L3 | `dashboard/` | Natural-language query → Intent Parsing → chart generation |

### Governance approval matrix (follow when implementing L1)

- `INSERT purchase_orders` → MANAGER approval
- `UPDATE inbound` (block/hold) → QC approval
- `INSERT recalls` → ADMIN approval
- `UPDATE production_lots.status = 'RECALLED'` → ADMIN approval

### Bidirectional LOT traceability chain (never break this when changing the schema)

```
suppliers → purchase_orders → purchase_order_items → inbound
→ raw_material_lots → production_ingredients → production_lots
→ outbound_lots → outbound → orders → customers
```

Reverse tracing (root-cause analysis) follows this chain backwards. Core invariants: `SUM(outbound_lots.lot_quantity) = outbound.quantity`, and `raw_material_lots.remaining_quantity` is decremented on production input.

### Korea localization invariants (the reason this design exists — do not change arbitrarily)

- 22 allergens (`allergens` master, not the EU 14)
- Electronic tax invoice columns (`tax_invoice_number` / `tax_invoice_date` — purchase_orders, orders)
- Recall: report to MFDS immediately, retain records for 2 years
- Certificates: HACCP/GMP/traceability registration (notify 30 days before expiry, block inbound on expiry)

The full flow and agent intervention points are the single source of truth (SSOT) in `docs/02_flow.md`. For the table list and SAP module mapping, see `docs/01_project_overview.txt`.

## Work comes from the board

Every goal this project has lives in GitHub. There is one board — [Mulino Coreano — ERP & Agent Governance](https://github.com/orgs/mulino-coreano/projects/1) — and its operating rules are in `docs/06_labels.md`, which outranks this file.

- **Goals are milestones (Phases) and issues.** A goal written only in a doc is an untracked goal.
- **Check the board when a session starts.** The `goals` skill has the commands for the current Phase and its goals; the `backlog` skill has the commands for the next candidate. The board is more current than the status described in this file or in `docs/`.
- **Do not start work that has no issue.** If nothing on the board covers it, stop and ask — do not create an issue and carry on by yourself. Questions, investigation and typo fixes are exempt.
- **Do not start work outside the current Phase on your own initiative.** Propose it; the human decides.
- **Never set the board's Status field by hand.** Automation derives it from issue and PR state.

Carrying out an issue is the `backlog` skill; changing what the goals are is the `goals` skill (both in `.agents/skills/`).

## Git rules

- **No direct commit/push to main** — work on a separate branch, then open a PR to merge (force push is strictly forbidden)
- Commit message prefixes: `feat` | `chore` | `fix` | `docs` (e.g. `feat(migration): create migration files`)

## Conventions
- The issue/PR label scheme is in `docs/06_labels.md` (category + `L0-db`~`L3-dashboard` layer labels)
- Never commit secrets (`application-local.yml`, `.env`) — already in `.gitignore`
- On schema changes, keep `docs/02_flow.md` consistent with the ERD (Phase 1 required "flow diagram–ERD 100% consistency" as an acceptance criterion)
- Skills live in `.agents/skills/` — dev-workflow skills (`backlog` to carry out an issue, `goals` to change what the goals are, `testing` to decide and write tests) as real directories, ERP role skills as symlinks to `agents/skills/`, which stays their SSOT (the L2 product layer). Codex discovers that directory natively.
- Claude Code does **not** read `.agents/skills/`, so `.claude/skills/` mirrors it with one symlink per skill. Add a skill in both places, and point the `.claude/skills/` link at the skill's real directory — never at another symlink.

## Prose (Korean text deliverables)

Commit messages, PR bodies, issue bodies and `docs/` all hold to the same standard,
and under Claude Code they are not written by the session doing the work.

- **Claude Code** — delegate to the `prose` subagent (`.claude/agents/prose.md`,
  pinned to `claude-sonnet-4-6`). Hand it the issue number or the branch; it reads
  the diff itself. Do **not** pass a `model` argument when invoking it — that
  overrides the pin and silently routes to a different model.
- **Codex** — has no equivalent subagent pinning. Write the prose yourself, to the
  rules below. They are the same rules the subagent follows.
- A cold subagent sees the diff, not the conversation. Cross-cutting rationale — why
  this approach over another, what a reviewer will object to — has to be handed to it
  in the prompt or it will not appear in the text.

### Voice

Korean, plain declarative (`-다`), no honorifics.

- **Why before what.** A body that only lists changed files is a worse `git diff
  --stat`. Lead with the reason the change exists — the wrong behaviour, the false
  assumption, the thing that broke.
- **Bullets are concrete.** Name the file, then what changed in it — not `문서 수정`.
- **Evidence goes in.** Commands run, output observed, versions checked. A claim with
  nothing behind it does not belong in the body.
- **Admit what you did not do.** Skipped verification, a known gap, a deliberate
  shortcut — write it down rather than letting the reader find it.
- Technical terms stay in English (`symlink`, `discovery`, `branch protection`). Do
  not force them into awkward Korean.
- No marketing tone, no 이모지. Wrap bodies at 72 columns.

## Issue/PR templates (mandatory)

Templates live in `.github/`. When creating issues or PRs, the session must follow the structure of the relevant template exactly — do not omit sections or invent your own format.

**PR**: `.github/pull_request_template.md` — 4 sections (작업 내용 / 변경 사항 / 체크리스트 / 리뷰 요청 사항). The 3 checklist items (verify local run, do not commit secrets, update related docs) must appear in the PR body.

**Korean PR requirement**: Always create pull requests from `.github/pull_request_template.md`, and write both the PR title and the entire PR body in Korean.

**Issues**: pick one of the following by task type (title prefix and label are auto-applied).
- `bug.md` — `[BUG]` · `bug` — bug report (bug description / reproduction steps / expected & actual behavior / environment)
- `feature.md` — `[FEAT]` · `feature` — feature development (overview / L0–L3 layer checkboxes / detailed tasks / definition of done / references)
- `qc.md` — `[QC]` · `qc` — QC/test (target / items / method / result Pass·Fail)
- `research.md` — `[RESEARCH]` · `research` — upfront research (purpose / items / result + sources / design impact / sources)

Check the `config.yml` contact link (project docs) before creating an issue. Blank issues are allowed, but for types that have a template, using the template is the default.
